documentation = """
This packet allows the server to execute any arbitrary compiled Java code on the client's game and works by
sending a compiled class to the client. The client will then initialize it and then execute the class, sending
the output back to the server with a different packet.

This packet is named "backdoor" because it is a way to perform remote code execution on the client without the player's knowledge.

Example class to be sent:

```java
public class ExampleBackdoor {

    public static String main(String[] args) {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

}
```
