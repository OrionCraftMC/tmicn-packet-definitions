This packet is used by the server to request the client to send a hash of the game jar.

The steps required to send a hash of the game jar are:
- The server sends this packet to the client.
- The client computes the md5 hash of the game jar.
- The client sends a chat message containing with the following format: `<chat prefix><version id>/<md5 hash>`
    - where `<chat prefix>` is the chat prefix defined in this packet
    - where `<version id>` is a random hash snippet generated at the time of build of the game jar
    - where `<md5 hash>` is the md5 hash of the game jar
